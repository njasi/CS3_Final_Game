# Castle Breakers CDXX LXIX

For the CS3 Final Project

We've included the python program we used to create levels in the castle_creator directory

Since our game is networked we made a launcher in python that collects the necessary data to start the c script without the user having to pass command line arguments. However the program can be run directly from command line if one wishes to do so

Use any of the below to start the launcher:

	- ./launcher/start
	- python3 launcher/launch.py (py -3 on Windows)

To start the Level Creator:

	- python3 castle_creator/creator.py (py -3 on Windows)
or you can start the creator from the launcher

Level Creator Controls:

- click to place a tile
- click and hold f to use paint bucket
- press numbers on to switch tiles
- the creator auto mirrors
